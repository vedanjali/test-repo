# My story
 Hi ! I'm **Vedanjali**. People generally don't spell my name right or even mispronounce it (which is more irritating). I'm not a huge fan of football probably because:
  - I don't watch it much
  - I think it is a violent game
  - I think it is over-rated
  
 That gives one enough reason to hate me but I assure you that I do admire certain things. :)
